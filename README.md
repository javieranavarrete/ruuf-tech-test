## How to run
This program runs on the CLI and receives four arguments, which can be integers or decimals, for example:

```bash
python Panel_Calculator.py 1 2 3 4 
python Panel_Calculator.py 1 1.5 4 6.5 
```

* The first two numbers must be the dimension of the panels, no matter the order.
* The last two numbers are the dimensions of the roof, no matter the order.

## Unit test
You can add test cases if you wish, and to run the unit test you need to have `pytest` on your device and execute the next command:
```bash
pytest test.py
```
